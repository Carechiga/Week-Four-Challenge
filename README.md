# Week-Four-Challenge
Week four challenge for UCI Bootcamp, Quiz
## Project Description
The objective for this project was to demonstrate our knowledge of JavaScript and Web APIs.
A timed quiz with questions about things we have learned up to this point in bootcamp at UCI, allows users to pick from a series of answers. 
The score is determined from a combination of correct answers and remaining time at the completion of the quiz's 10 questions.
Each time an incorrect answer is chosen the 20 seconds is deducted from the remaining time.
At the end of the quiz the user can submit their name and their score/name will be stored to local memory and displayed in the most recent score section.
